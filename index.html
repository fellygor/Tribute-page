                <p style="padding-top: 20px; line-height: 30px">The Mau Mau Uprising is a war that took place between 1952 and 1960.
                    It was also known as the Mau Mau rebellion, the Kenya Revolt or the Mau Mau Revolt.
                    The war was mainly between the British authorities and the Kenya Land Freedom Army.
                
                The leader of this rebellion was <b>Field Marshal Dedan Kimathi</b>.
                The revolt was mainly demonstrated by Kikuyu, Embu and Meru people. However, it also comprised
                of both the Kamba and Maasai.
                The Mau Mau revolt initiated the decolonization of Kenya from Britain
                by facilitating the transition from the period of colonization to independence.

                    <p>Mau Mau, militant African nationalist movement that originated in the 1950s among the Kikuyu people of Kenya. 
                        The Mau Mau (origin of the name is uncertain) advocated violent resistance to British domination in Kenya; 
                        the movement was especially associated with the ritual oaths employed by leaders of the Kikuyu Central 
                        Association to promote unity in the independence movement.
                        In 1950 the Mau Mau were banned by British authorities, and in October 1952, after a campaign of sabotage 
                        and assassination attributed to Mau Mau terrorists, the British Kenya government declared a state of emergency 
                        and began four years of military operations against Kikuyu rebels.

                   <p>  By the end of 1956, more than 11,000 rebels 
                    had been killed in the fighting, along with about 100 Europeans and 2,000 African loyalists. More than 20,000 o
                    ther Kikuyu were put into detention camps, where intensive efforts were made to convert them to the political v
                    iews of the government—i.e., to abandon their nationalist aspirations.</p>
                    <p> Despite these government actions, Kikuyu 
                    resistance spearheaded the Kenya independence movement, and Jomo Kenyatta, who had been jailed as a Mau Mau leader
                     in 1953, became prime minister of an independent Kenya 10 years later. 
                    In 2003 the ban on the Mau Mau was lifted by the Kenyan government. Read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mau_Mau_rebellion">here</a></p>
